[Verse 1]
Every night, 'round about this time
It's like she knows I'm lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leanin' on old memories
And talkin' 'bout what used to be
She'll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain't sweet

[Chorus]
She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty littlе poison

[Verse 2]
Shadows dancin' down the hall
Whispers that she wants mе
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind of fix
For me, she's the one I'll pick
Nothin' else will do the trick
She's all I need
[Chorus]
She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

[Bridge]
For some, I guess it's alcohol
I don't want none at all
I just want you
No, I just want you

[Chorus]
My pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison
She's my pretty little poison
