On the gang, gang
On the gang, gang
Woo

[Verse 1]
Yeah, run up on big Glo, you won't, I bet your ass be on the floor
Big carbon hit like Mayweather, Tula come through and bow a ho
Got millions out that rap shit, they hate a bitch, but they stole the flow
Got backend after backend comin', fuck 'em, I stole the show
Don't run up on that bitch, she a headcase, all she do is shoot
I signed my deal up on a PJ and hopped out a parachute
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might just stare at you
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might embarrass you

[Chorus]
(Yeah, Glo) Stomp a lil' pussy ho with some shell toes
(Yeah, Glo) Slappin' rap bitches and makin' bail, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Two-tone Cartier match the nails, ho
(Yeah, Glo) No competition, these bitches stale, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Cuban on Cuban, my shit in layers, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Say they get money, but I can't tell, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Keep runnin' circles around these snail hoes
(Yeah, Glo) And my shit bumpin' up in the jail, ho
On the gang
[Verse 2]
"Big Glo, where you been at?" "Mane, everywhere, I'm workin' hard"
Maybach and G-Wagon trucks, got M&M's in my garage
Quick to crank up on a ho, you bitches better not get me started
Locked in with the gangstas and players, my folks gon' keep it solid
Everything I got on new, it look like I got renovated (Ayy)
I'm cocky, bitch, when I was just humble they didn't appreciate it (Fuck 'em)
Young, wealthy, and ratchet, I'm the hood bitches' motivation (Stamped it)
On top of the world now, they tried to underestimate me (Haha)

[Refrain]
(Get 'em, Glo) Them bitches fraudulent, you know you the truth
(Get 'em, Glo) Stop overthinkin', these hoes can't fuck with you (Period)
(Get 'em, Glo) Standin' on business in these Chanel shoes
Before I let a ho play with me, I'll go eat some jail food, on gang

[Chorus]
(Yeah, Glo) Stomp a lil' pussy ho with some shell toes
(Yeah, Glo) Slappin' rap bitches and makin' bail, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Two-tone Cartier match the nails, ho
(Yeah, Glo) No competition, these bitches stale, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Cuban on Cuban, my shit in layers, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Say they get money, but I can't tell, ho
(Yeah, Glo) Keep runnin' circles around these snail hoes
(Yeah, Glo) And my shit bumpin' up in the jail, ho
[Outro]
(On the gang) Yeah, Glo
Yeah, Glo
