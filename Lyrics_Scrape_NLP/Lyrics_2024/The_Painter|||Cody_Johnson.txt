[Verse 1]
She talks about the future like she's flippin' through a magazine
Finds the beauty in the thrown away and broken things
Gets excited about all my crazy dreams

[Verse 2]
Got every sunset that she's ever seen memorized
Saves them away for a rainy day or stormy night
The sky is brighter lookin' at it through her eyes

[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter

[Verse 3]
She reminds me that it ain't too late to start again
Fine is good, but you need some blue every now and then
How'd I live so long without her reckless touch?

[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter
[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter

[Outro]
She's the painter
