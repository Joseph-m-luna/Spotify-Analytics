[Intro: Chorus]
Ding-dong-ding
Ding-dong-ding

[Verse 1: Burl Ives & ]
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
It's the best time of the year 
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And when you walk down the street 
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

[Pre-Chorus: Burl Ives, , ]
, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you 
Kiss her once for me

[Chorus: Burl Ives & ]
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And in case you didn't hear 
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

[Interlude: Chorus]
Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
[Verse 2: Burl Ives]
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

[Pre-Chorus: Burl Ives, , ]
, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you 
Kiss her once for me

[Chorus: Burl Ives & ]
Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And in case you didn't hear 
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

[Outro: Chorus]
Ding-dong-ding-dong
Ding-dong-ding-dong
Ding-dong-ding
