[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
Somebody save me, me from myself
I've spent so long livin' in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help

[Pre-Chorus: Jelly Roll]
All of this drinkin' and smokin' is hopeless
But feel like it's all that I need
Somethin' inside of me's broken, I hold on
To anything that sets me free

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Lifе has shattered my hopes and my drеams

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lainey Wilson]
What if the night sky was missin' the moon?
There were no shootin' stars to use wishin' on you
And all of my sorrows, I'd just wash them down
It's the only peace I've ever found

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
All of this drinkin' and smokin' is hopeless
But feel like it's all that I need
Somethin' inside of me's broken, I hold on
To anything that sets me free

[Chorus: Both, , ]
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
