[Intro]
Look, let me tell you (Girl)

[Chorus]
You my lil' boo thang
So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shootin' that shot like 2K, girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know

[Verse]
Put a lil' gold in the teeth
And the fit good, so I took the doors off the Jeep, okay
I see a brother holdin' your seat, no beef
But I'm tryna get to know you at least
Don't take my talkin' to you wrong
I can keep it chill like a sauvignon blanc
I'ma keep it real when your man long gone
If you're lookin' for a friend, then you got thе wrong song

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl, what's good, what's with ya?
If you booked tonight, that's fiction
I'm outside, no pictures
You want mе, go figure
To the back, to the front
You a ten, baby girl, but I'm the one (Hey)
To the back, to the front
You a ten, baby girl, but I'm the one (One)
[Chorus]
You my lil' boo thang
So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shootin' that shot like 2K, girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know

[Bridge]
Ayy
Girl, you got me
I'm singin', it's like
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, you got the best of my love
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, you got the best of my, my
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, you got the best of my love
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, and in that dress I'm like (Woah)

[Chorus]
You my lil' boo thang (Yeah)
So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shootin' that shot like 2K, girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know
