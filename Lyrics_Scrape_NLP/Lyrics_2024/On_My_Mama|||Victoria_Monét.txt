[Verse 1: Victoria Monét]
When they say, "She get it from her mama"
I'ma say, "You fuckin' right"
Body rude, it's unpolite
Done bein' the humble type
Tell me, is you down?
'Cause I'm tryna go up tonight
Hoes and hoochies left and right

[Pre-Chorus: Victoria Monét]
I just wanna live in a fantasy
I think we deserve it, right?
Top all the memories
I've ever made in my life
Permanent ecstasy (Oh)
Ladies is pimps tonight
Livin' inside a dream (Oh)
Let's lay where the lovers lie

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
I put that on my own mama, on my hood
I look fly, I look good
You can't touch my bag, wish you could
I look fly, I look too good
Put that on my own mama, on my hood
I look fly, I look good
You can't touch my bag, wish you could
I look fly, I look too good
[Post-Chorus: Chalie Boy]
On my mama (Mama), on my hood (Hood)
I look fly (Yeah), I look good (Good)
Touch my swag (Swag), wish you could (Could)
I look fly (Yeah), I look good (Good, good, good)

[Verse 2: Victoria Monét]
I'm so deep in my bag
Like a grandma with a peppermint
They say, "Ooh, she smell good"
That's just 'cause I'm Heaven-sent
Sex game go stupid (Ayy)
Snappin' like a toothpick (Ayy)
Man, to tell the truth, your opinion is irrelevant

[Pre-Chorus: Victoria Monét]
But I, I know you think I'm fine
Might be too fine to hit it from behind
Reflection in the mirror don't decline
I can't even lie, lie, lie

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
I put that on my own mama, on my hood
I look fly, I look good
You can't touch my bag, wish you could
I look fly, I look too good
Put that on my own mama, on my hood (On my mama, on my hood, ayy)
I look fly, I look good (I look fly, I look good, ayy, ayy)
You can't touch my bag, wish you could (Touch my bag, you wish you could)
I look fly, I look too good
[Post-Chorus: Chalie Boy,  & ]
On my mama (Mama), on my hood (Hood)
I look fly (Yeah), I look good (Good)
 (Swag), wish you could (Could)
I look fly (Yeah), I look good (Good)
On my mama (Mama), on my hood (Hood)

I look fly (Yeah), I look good (Good)

Touch my swag (Swag), wish you could (Could)

I look fly (Yeah), I look good (Good, good, good)

[Outro: Victoria Monét]
Mama, on my hood
I look fly, I look good
I know you wish you could
