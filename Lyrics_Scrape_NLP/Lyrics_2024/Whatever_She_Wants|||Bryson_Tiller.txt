[Intro]
Nah, we just gettin' started
It's Slum Tiller, Volume 2, nigga
My boy Tylian snapped on this shit
We got this motherfucker goin' crazy and we don't even know-
Can't see yo' at, peace, nigga, you know what time it is
Uh

[Chorus]
I'ma take her bougie ass to Rodeo and then let her pick up whatever she want
CC, Gucci, hit Bottega, whatever she want
She piss me off, somehow she still get whatever she want
Talking 'bout her nails, I'm finna nail her ass at home
Hit it in the shower, made her tell me where she want (Huh)
Like I'm singin' Mase, I made her tell me what she want (Huh, huh)
(Huh-huh, huh-huh-huh, wow)

[Verse 1]
She on a power trip again
I know pussy power got me buyin' shit again
Friends ain't jackin' me, you must be lyin' to your friends
They know I'm a beast, I wake the giants up again (Huh-huh, huh-huh-huh)
Shinin' once again
Ran it up, I told lil' mama, "Slide in my DMs" (Huh, uh)
Now I'm right back in, oh
Locked in
Shawty got that dress on so the block is hot again
Thick so when I hit it sound like Flocka adlibs (Baow-baow, baow-baow-baow)
Got her ass again
Then she got to trippin' over nothin' yet again
Got a nigga feelin' like a sucker yet again
Close off my emotion then I rush to let her in
Hurry up and let her in (Huh)
[Chorus]
I'ma take her bougie ass to Rodeo and then let her pick up whatever she want
CC, Gucci, hit Bottega, whatever she want
She piss me off, somehow she still get whatever she want
Talking 'bout her nails, I'm finna nail her ass at home
Hit it in the shower, made her tell me where she want (Want)
Like I'm singin' Mase, I made her tell me what she want (Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh)

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, I)
I'm already knowin' (I)
She spoiled as a motherfucker
Whatever

[Verse 2]
Huh
Spoil her ass again
Take her to the dealership, the Porsche got a twin, huh
Patek got a beam, huh, hold it to the lens
Put the ice I bought you on and show it to your friends, huh
Shop until we lean, huh
Bae, let's make it even (Ayy)
She don't hold a damn thing, she spicy like Tajin (Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot)
Ha, yeah, she spicy like Tajin, ayy, look, bae, don't make no sense

[Chorus]
I'm finna take her bougie ass to Rodeo and then let her pick up whatever she want
CC, Gucci, hit Bottega, whatever she want
She piss me off, somehow she still get whatever she want (Uh-huh)
Talking 'bout her nails, I'm finna nail her ass at home
Hit it in the shower, made her tell me where she want (Huh)
Like I'm singin' Mase, I made her tell me what she want (Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh)
