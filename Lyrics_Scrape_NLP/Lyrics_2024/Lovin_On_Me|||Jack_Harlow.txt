[Intro: Cadillac Dale]
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

[Chorus: Jack Harlow,  & ]
I'm vanilla, baby ()
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby ()
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby ()
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby ()
And the thing about your boy is

  (That's right, that's right)
 

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Young J-A-C-K, AKA
Rico like Suave, Young Enrique
Speakin' of AKA, she's a alpha
But not around your boy, she get quiet 'round your boy, hold on (Shh)
Don't know what you heard or what you thought about your boy
But they lied about your boy, goin' dumb and it's somethin' idiotic 'bout your boy
She wearin' cheetah print
That's how bad she wanna bе spotted 'round your boy

[Pre-Chorus: Cadillac Dale]
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie mе down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me
[Chorus: Jack Harlow,  & ]
I'm vanilla, baby ()
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby ()
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby ()
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby ()
And the thing about your boy is
 
 

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
Young M-I-S-S-I-O-N-A-R-Y
You sharp like barbed wire
She stole my heart, then she got archived
I keep it short with a bitch, Lord Farquaad
All the girls in the front row (Ayy)
All the girls at the barricade (Ayy)
All the girls that been waitin' all day
Let your tongue hang out, fuck everything (Ayy)
If you came with a man (Came with a man)
Let go of his hand (Let go of that shit)
Everybody in the suite kickin' up they feet
Stand up, bitch, dance

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Harlow & ]
 (I see you, and all the guys in the back waitin' on the next track)
 (Cut your boy a lil' slack)
 (It's young Jack)
[Chorus: Jack Harlow,  & ]
I'm vanilla, baby ()
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby ()
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby ()
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby ()
And the thing about your boy is
  (That's right, that's right)
 

[Outro: Cadillac Dale]
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby
