[Intro: Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

[Post-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga, ]
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore

And our love's the only war 

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, ]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile


[Bridge: Bruno Mars,  ]
Right next to you


Oh-oh
[Chorus: Lady Gaga, , ]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to 
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was 
 



[Outro: Bruno Mars, ]
(Ooh, ooh)
