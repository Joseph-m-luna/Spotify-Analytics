[Verse 1]
I know I might look like
Another ball cap on a bar stool
Underneath a PBR light
Sayin' everything under the moon
To get you into my arms tonight
You probably heard it all a thousand times
But it ain't what it looks like
Girl, let me tell you what it looks like

[Chorus]
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
You look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you

[Verse 2]
I gotta tell you, baby, I've been
The kind of boy your daddy never wanted
You to go and fall in love with
The kinda boys you're probably done with their dumb shit, yeah
I bet you heard the stories and
Can't say I'm proud of that, but
I've turned the page on the old me
And now I ain't lookin' back 'cause
[Chorus]
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin'

[Bridge]
Missin' you in the mornin'
Probably for the next few years
When I look back on it
I'll still see you right here

[Chorus]
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you
[Outro]
Wind up missin' you
Wind up missin' you
