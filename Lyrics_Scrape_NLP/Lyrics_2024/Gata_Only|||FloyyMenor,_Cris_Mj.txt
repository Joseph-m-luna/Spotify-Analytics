[Intro: Cris Mj]
Ayy

[Refrain: Cris Mj & ]
Baby, I feel you far away, tell me where you are
I want to fuck you, I'm gonna take you away
Let yourself go, turn off the cellphone
'Cause if you're with me, nothing will happen to you
Just let yourself go
Baby, watch out for the play
I want it with you and you want it with me ()
Tell me if it happens

[Chorus: FloyyMenor]
Ba-ba-baby, go on, get ready for me, follow me
You are like for me and I am for you
Girl, you're alone, send me your location
Move your ass to the rhythm of the TikTok
That girl ran away with me and nobody noticed at home
Because with me that baby had a grеat time tonight
Girl, put the cellphonе on airplane mode
You're my crazy girl and I'm your crazy guy
You make yourself for me and I'll go all in

[Refrain: FloyyMenor & ]
Baby, I feel you far away, tell me where you are (Ah-ah)
I want to fuck you, I'm gonna take you away
Let yourself go, turn off the cellphone
'Cause if you're with me, nothing will happen to you
Just let yourself go
Baby, watch out for the play
I want it with you and you want it with me ()
(Tell me if it happens)
[Chorus: Cris Mj]
Ba-ba-baby, go on, get ready for me, follow me
You are like for me, I'm your Brad Pitt
Girl, you're only, send me your location
Move it, dance to the rhythm of the TikTok
That girl ran away with me
The one who fucks her is me
I stole her when we were young

[Verse: Cris Mj & ]
Another night giving you (Eh), giving you (Eh)
Touching you (Eh), heating you up
Climaxing on top of you (Okay)
Moaning in my ear (Ha)
And I keep making her fall in love, giving her presents, buying stuff all day long
Whatever you want, baby girl
Now we're drifting apart, I'm not seeing you, the days go by
Being alone is what you prefer
Come and give me a chance to grind on you
To get you all wet down there


[Chorus: Cris Mj]
Baby, go on, get ready for me, follow me
You are like for me, I'm your Brad Pitt
Girl, you're only, send me your location
Move it, dance to the rhythm of the TikTok
That girl ran away with me
The one who fucks her is me
I stole her when we were young
[Outro: FloyyMenor & ]

(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You already know who, you already know who we are ()
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah) FloyyMenor

(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)

(Baby, I feel you far away, tell me where you are)
(I want to fuck you, I'm gonna take you away)
(Let yourself go, turn off the cellphone)
('Cause if you're with me, nothing will happen to you)
You and me in La SerenaOn the Avenida del Mar
