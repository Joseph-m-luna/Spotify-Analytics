[Verse 1]
Usually, these ol' neon lights
Are pretty good for bad goodbyes
They got some girls off of my mind
But, baby, not tonight
'Cause I've been puttin' in overtime
Tryin' to get over your leavin'
You're still right here, on my mind
You sure did a number on me

[Chorus]
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything thеy've got
But the whiskey don't kill likе it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way I'm driving home
I'm three sheets, done tied one on
But this liquor ain't as strong
As your sweet love is
[Chorus]
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything they've got
But the whiskey don't kill like it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

[Bridge]
All my favorite country songs
Guess they must've got it wrong
'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone
You ain't gone, baby

[Chorus]
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything they've got
But the whiskey don't kill like it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof
[Outro]
All my favorite country songs
Guess they must've got it wrong
'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone
You ain't gone, baby
Oh-oh, you ain't gone, baby
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof
