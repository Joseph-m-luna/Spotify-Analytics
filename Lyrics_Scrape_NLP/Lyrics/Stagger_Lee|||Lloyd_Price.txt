[Intro]
The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

[Verse 1]
I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men who were gambling in the dark
(Da da, da da)
It was Stagger Lee and Billy, two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight

[Verse 2]
Stagger Lee told Billy, "I can't let you go with that"
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)
"You have won all my money and my brand new Stetson hat"
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)
Said, "I'm going to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe"
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)
Go on, Stagger Lee (Da da, da da)

[Break]
Look out there now (Ooh, wah)
Come on, Stag, stop playing (Ooh, wah)
(Ooh ooh wah)
(Wah)
[Verse 3]
Stagger Lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door
Said, "Now nobody move" and he pulled his forty-four
(Ooh ooh, da, da, da, da)
"Stagger Lee," cried Billy, "Oh, please don't take my life"
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)
"I got three little children and a very sickly wife"
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)

[Verse 3]
Stagger Lee shot Billy, oh, he shot that poor boy so bad
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee)
Now look out, Stag, go  (Go Stagger Lee)

[Outro]
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee) Yeah, do the move there
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee) Get out of there, Stag
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee) Oh, please Stagger
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee) Come on now, Stag
You do the move there
(Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee) Come on, Stag
