[Verse 1]
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna be stand on the corner Twelfth Street and Vine
I'm gonna be stand on the corner Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby and a bottle of Kansas City wine

[Bridge]
Well, I might take a train, I might take a plane
But if I could walk I'm going just the same
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one

(Ah, but you know, yeah, mercy!)

[Instrumental Break]

(Aw, yeah!)

[Bridge]
Now, if I stay with that woman I know I'm gonna die
Gotta find a brand new baby, that's the reason why
Going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one
[Outro]
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy little women there, and I'm gonna get me one
