Over and over
I tried to prove my love to you
Over and over
What more can I do?

Over and over
My friend says I'm a fool
But over and over
I'll be a fool for you

'Cuz you've got (personality)
Walk (with personality)
Talk (with personality)
Smile (with personality)
Charm (with personality)
Love (with personality)
And plus you've got a great big heart

So over (over and over) and over (over and over)
Oh, I'll be (over and over) a fool for you (over and over)
Now over (over and over) and over (over and over)
What more can I do?

'Cuz you've got (personality)
Walk (with personality)
Talk (with personality)
Smile (with personality)
Charm (with personality)
Love (with personality)
And plus you've got a great big heart
So over (over and over) and over (over and over)
Oh, I'll be (over and over) a fool for you (over and over)
Now over (over and over) and over (over and over)
What more can I do?

Oh oh oh, over and over
I said that I love you
Over and over
Honey, now it's the truth

Over and over
They still says I'm a fool
But over and over
I'll be a fool for you

'Cuz you've got (personality)
Walk (with personality)
Talk (with personality)
Smile (with personality)
Charm (with personality)
Love (with personality)
And plus you've got a great big heart

So over (over and over) and over (over and over)
Whoa, I'll be (over and over) a fool for you (over and over)
Now over (over and over) and over (over and over)
What more can I do?
