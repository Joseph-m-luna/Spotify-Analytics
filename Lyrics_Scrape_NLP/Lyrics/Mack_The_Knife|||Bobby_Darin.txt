Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it outta sight

You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears old Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace o' red

Now, on the side walk
Ooh Sunday morning, ah, ah
Lies a body just oozin' life, eek!
An' someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat, ah, ah, ah-ah
Down by the river, don't you know?
Where a cement bag's just a-droopin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, old Mack he's back in town

Now did ya hear about Louie Miller?
He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath, spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?
Na, na, Jenny Diver, ho ho, Suky Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mack, he's back in town

I said, Jenny Diver, whoa, Suky Tawdry
Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mack, he's back in town

Look out old Mack, he is back!
