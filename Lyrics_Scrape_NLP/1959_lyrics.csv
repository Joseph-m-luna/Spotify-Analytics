Teddy Swims,Lose Control,"[Verse 1]
Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

[Verse 2]
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh
[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me"
Shaboozey,A Bar Song (Tipsy),"[Verse 1]
My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Verse 2]
I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh, Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh, Lord
[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (We go way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Bridge]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)

[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (It's Jack D)
At the bottom of a bottle, don't miss me (Baby, don't miss me)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
[Post-Chorus]
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Outro]
That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar"
Benson Boone,Beautiful Things,"[Verse 1]
For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

[Chorus]
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ooh
Please don't take

[Verse 2]
I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

[Chorus]
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ooh

[Outro]
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
I need
These beautiful things that I've got"

Jack Harlow,Lovin On Me,"[Intro: Cadillac Dale]
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

[Chorus: Jack Harlow,  & ]
I'm vanilla, baby ()
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby ()
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby ()
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby ()
And the thing about your boy is

  (That's right, that's right)
 

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Young J-A-C-K, AKA
Rico like Suave, Young Enrique
Speakin' of AKA, she's a alpha
But not around your boy, she get quiet 'round your boy, hold on (Shh)
Don't know what you heard or what you thought about your boy
But they lied about your boy, goin' dumb and it's somethin' idiotic 'bout your boy
She wearin' cheetah print
That's how bad she wanna bе spotted 'round your boy

[Pre-Chorus: Cadillac Dale]
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie mе down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me
[Chorus: Jack Harlow,  & ]
I'm vanilla, baby ()
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby ()
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby ()
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby ()
And the thing about your boy is
 
 

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
Young M-I-S-S-I-O-N-A-R-Y
You sharp like barbed wire
She stole my heart, then she got archived
I keep it short with a bitch, Lord Farquaad
All the girls in the front row (Ayy)
All the girls at the barricade (Ayy)
All the girls that been waitin' all day
Let your tongue hang out, fuck everything (Ayy)
If you came with a man (Came with a man)
Let go of his hand (Let go of that shit)
Everybody in the suite kickin' up they feet
Stand up, bitch, dance

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Harlow & ]
 (I see you, and all the guys in the back waitin' on the next track)
 (Cut your boy a lil' slack)
 (It's young Jack)
[Chorus: Jack Harlow,  & ]
I'm vanilla, baby ()
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby ()
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby ()
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby ()
And the thing about your boy is
  (That's right, that's right)
 

[Outro: Cadillac Dale]
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby"
Kendrick Lamar,Not Like Us,"[Intro]
Psst, I see dead people
()

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

[Verse 2]
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

[Bridge]
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" ()
Say, ""OV-ho"" ()
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way

Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way

"
Hozier,Too Sweet,"[Verse 1]
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world

[Chorus]
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day

[Chorus]
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

I take my whiskey neat

Noah Kahan,Stick Season,"[Verse 1]
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

[Verse 2]
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back
[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

[Bridge]
Oh, that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it

[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
Have to do"

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it ()
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it ()

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying ()
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying ()
[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I gave it all I could

[Pre-Chorus]
Stuck in this terradome (Ooh)
All I see is terrible (Ooh)
Making us hysterical (Ooh)
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine (Ooh)
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze (Ooh)
Nirvana's not as advertised (Ooh)
There's got to be more, been here before

[Chorus]
Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away
Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Find something worth saving
It's all for the taking
I always say

I'll be better on Saturn
None of this matters
Dreaming of Saturn, oh

Ooh

[Verse 1]
I'll touch that fire for you
I do that three, four times again, I testify for you
I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you

[Chorus]
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
I can't just snooze and miss the moment
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do

In a droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)
Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (Your main one)

Sex remind you I'm nonviolent, I'm your day one (Day one)
We ain't have shit yet, it was magic, yeah
Smash and grab shit, yeah
Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
Ain't a home when you not here
Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'

I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do

[Bridge]
Main one ridin'
How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
How you threatenin' to leave and I'm the main one cryin'?
Just tryna be your everything
Main one ridin'
How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
How you threatenin' to leave and I'm the main one cryin'?

I can't lose when I'm with you (Like you, like you)
How can I snooze and miss the moment? (Like you)

You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis

I don't need a new fan 'cause my boo like it
I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it
I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?
Throw a shot like you tryna have a food fight then
All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet
Said I got drive, I don't need a car
Money really all that we fiendin' for
I'm doin' things they ain't seen before
Fans ain't dumb, but extremists are
I'm a demon lord
Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse
Called your bluff, better cite the source
Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Em đáng ra phải bị bắt đi rồi
Nhưng người ta đã quên đến đón em
Em là một con sâu rượu đang sống ổn thoả
Cho đến khi chẳng còn ai để ý đến gu thẩm mỹ mới của em nữa
Tất cả để nói rằng
Em mong anh vẫn ổn
Nhưng anh chính là lý do
Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu
Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?

[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift]
Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình bên nhau muôn đời
Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết
Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt
Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, , ]
Những sớm mai của em là những thứ Hai mắc kẹt trong một 
Em đã uống thứ thuốc bước tiếp diệu kỳ, nhưng 
Và em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em

Em chạm vào anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần

Nghĩ đến chuyện gọi em, nhưng em chẳng bắt máy
Thêm 2 tuần nữa lạc giữa xứ cờ hoa
Chuyển đến Florida, 
Nhưng nó chẳng nổ máy tới khi em 
"
Luke Combs,Fast Car,"[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did
[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

Dasha,Austin (Boots Stop Workin'),"[Verse 1]
We had a plan, move out of this town, baby
West to the sand, it's all we talked about lately
I'd pack the car, bring your guitar and Jane for smokin'
First thing at dawn, you'd queue the songs and we'd get goin'
But you weren't home, waited on the porch for ya
Sat there alone, all throughout the morn' 'til I
Got a hunch down in my gut and snuck around the back
Empty cans and I'll be damned, your shit was never packed

Did your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it
Was the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years, you'll still be here, drunk washed up in Austin

What happened? Bad habits?
Did you go back? Go batshit?

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips

And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

Zach Bryan,Pink Skies,"[Verse 1]
The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy

[Verse 2]
So clean the house, clear the drawers, mop the floors, stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1"" back in '08

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppiеs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God hеard you comin'

The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out, never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud

Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

[Chorus]
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine

When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?

Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Yeah, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout me?"
Beyoncé,TEXAS HOLD 'EM,"[Chorus]
This ain't Texas (Woo)
Ain't no hold 'em (Hey)
So lay your cards down, down, down, down
So park your Lexus (Woo)
And throw your keys up (Hey)
Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (Stick around)
And I'll be damned if I can't slow-dance with you
Come pour some sugar on me, honey, too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo, ha (Woo)

[Verse 1]
There's a tornado (There's a tornado)
In my city (In my city)

Off red-cup kisses, sweet redemption, passin' time, yeah

Come pour some sugar on me, honey, too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo
And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you

It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo

[Post-Chorus]
Woo-hoo

[Verse 2]
There's a heatwave (There's a heatwave)
Comin' at us (Comin' at us)
Too hot to think straight (Too hot to think straight)
Too cold to panic (Cold to panic)
All of the problems
Just feel dramatic (Just feel dramatic)
And now we're runnin' to the first bar that we find, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, one step to the right
We heading to the dive bar we always thought was nice
Ooh, you run to the left
Just work me in the middle, boy, I can't read your mind

[Chorus]
This ain't Texas (Woo)
Ain't no hold 'em (Hey)
So lay your cards down, down, down, down, oh
So park your Lexus (Hey)
And throw your keys up (Hey)
And stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (Stick around)
And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you
Come pour some sugar on me, honey, too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now (Woo)
And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you
Come pour some liquor on me, honey, too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a—, come take it to the floor now, ooh

[Outro]
Take it to the floor now, ooh
Hoops, spurs, boots
To the floor now, ooh
Tuck, back, oops (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shoot
Come take it to the floor now, ooh
And I'll be damned if I cannot dance with you
Baby, pour that sugar and liquor on me, too
Furs, spurs, boots
Solargenic, photogenic, shoot"
Taylor Swift,Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),"[Intro]
()

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
()

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone
[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
()
Uh-huh
()
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no

Taylor Swift,I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
()

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
()

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
()

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
()

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[Outro]
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"

Luke Combs,Ain't No Love In Oklahoma,"[Verse 1]
I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins
Like a shot down tailspun airplane
Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

[Verse 2]
I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the samе old dead-end highway
[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

[Chorus]
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain"

Pretty bitch with white toes

I done fucked her in the Rolls ()
I done pulled up in the Ghost
I done reachеd all my goals
Yeah, yeah, pull up with Yeezy and Dolla $ign
I'm all about business, I'm mindin' minе
Pull up in the trenches like Columbine
Pull up with the rocket like NumbaNine
I don't want your hoes
Young nigga reach all the goals
Let her suck the dick, said she was a pro
If she scrape her teeth, I'ma tell her to go

I gave that bitch a cramp
They love me out in France
In the hood, I'm good, I'm stamped
Every day, I dress all black
For a show, nine hundred racks
Middle East call, double that
On my neck a bubble bath
On my wrist, new Cadillac
Cut her off, don't want her back
Little bitch, I'm a superstar
These hoes wanna fuck my car
My dog put a nigga in park
Gotta watch out for the narcs, ayy
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
This that , Yeezy, not the clones
Elon, where my rocket ship? It's time to go home
They served us the porn since the day we was born
Anybody pissed off, gotta make 'em drink the urine
Now I'm Ye-Kelly, bitch, now I'm Bill Cosby, bitch
Now, I'm Puff Daddy rich, that's Me Too me rich
Why she say she sucked my dick? Then she say she ain't sucked my dick?
She gon' take it up the ass like a ventriloquist
I mean since Taylor Swift, since I had the Rollie on the wrist
I'm the new Jesus, bitch, I turn water to Cris'

Movin', I feel like I'm Jason, can't get arrested, I make 'em stumble
She want a private section, roll off them X's when I'm on Melrose
She tatted my name on her titties, yeah, you can bust it, but it's a borrow
Hol' up, sittin' back, countin' up dubs, I was raised in the borough
She wanna taste it, checkin' the swag today, ho, come back tomorrow
If you know what I know, hide your ho
Just off the facts that we havin' them hunchos
Runnin' around in the lobby, I know that they tired of me havin' like ten hoes
She need some cresidentials just to be presidential, hol' up, hol' up
I'm 'bout to buy her some dentures, make that ho eat me for dinner, woah, woah
Pain all in my eyes, I can't see, uh
I'm 'bout to jump out my body, I'm ready to leap, uh
I'm 'bout to nut on her body and tell the ho leave, 'kay
Fifty mil' stuffed in the bag, tell the whole gang eat, uh
It's Ye and Barti, tell me who fuckin' with we?

Well, look what the stork brung

And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb
(Bleah) With a forehead that it grew horns from
Still a white jerk
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher with the vic's, percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician, an electrician y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me
If I was to ever take a leave, It would be aspirin to break a feve
If I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat? (Ha!)
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back, like
[Chorus: Eminem]
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now back in the days of old me
(When) Right around the time I became a dope fiend
Ate some codeine, as a way of coping taste of opiates, case of O.E
​Turned me into smiley face emoji
My shit may not be age appropri—
Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout to turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out
To shut me down so when I started this verse
It did start off light-hearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed, look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin, and I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best but ops I'm white-chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my god, it's him... not again!""
[Chorus: Eminem]
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

[Bridge: Eminem]
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say
(If what?) If he could see the way shit is today
(Look at this shit, man) He'd probably say that everything is gay
(Like happy!) What's my name, what's my name?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group, the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world, 'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself, I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me what? Okay, that's it, go ahead, Paul, quit
Snake-ass prick, you male crossdresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that
(Watch) But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you, fuck my own kids they're brats (Fuck 'em)
They can screw-off, them and you all
You too, Paul, got two balls, big as RuPaul's, what you thought you saw ain't what you saw
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini, I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving, like
[Chorus: Eminem]
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh"

Benson Boone,Slow It Down,"[Verse 1]
I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're

[Pre-Chorus]
In your head right now
While your world is spinning out

[Chorus]
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down
[Verse 2]
Ain't it funny how it changes?
How the future rearranges
I get nervous, oh, I'm anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that's never left me is my mother
Oh, I love her
And I know you'll probably hate it, but I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
In my head right now

[Chorus]
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me (Slow it down)

[Breakdown]
Slow it down
When you're on the ground
And you're crying
I'm trying (Slow it down)
To slow it down
When you're spinning 'round
In your head
[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll help you slow it down"

Yeah, run up on big Glo, you won't, I bet your ass be on the floor
Big carbon hit like Mayweather, Tula come through and bow a ho
Got millions out that rap shit, they hate a bitch, but they stole the flow
Got backend after backend comin', fuck 'em, I stole the show
Don't run up on that bitch, she a headcase, all she do is shoot
I signed my deal up on a PJ and hopped out a parachute

Locked in with the gangstas and players, my folks gon' keep it solid
Everything I got on new, it look like I got renovated (Ayy)
I'm cocky, bitch, when I was just humble they didn't appreciate it (Fuck 'em)
Young, wealthy, and ratchet, I'm the hood bitches' motivation (Stamped it)
On top of the world now, they tried to underestimate me (Haha)

Just one more tear to cry, one teardrop from my eye
You better save it for
The middle of the night when things aren't black and white
Enter, Troubadour
""Remember twenty-four?""

[Chorus]
And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning

[Verse 2]
This song has started now, and you're just finding out
Now isn't that a laugh?
A major sacrifice, but clueless at the time
Enter, Caroline
""Just trust me, you'll be fine""

And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning

Oh, mm-mm

[Chorus]
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh

[Verse 1]
""Call me when you're there""
Said, ""I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'""
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair

[Refrain]
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh
[Chorus]
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I just wanna get her off, oh
Oh
Oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
She's takin' pictures in the mirror
Oh, my God, her skin's so clear
Tell her, ""Bring that over here""
You need a seat? I'll volunteer
Now she's smilin' ear to ear
She's the headlights, I'm the deer

[Bridge]
I've said it all before, but I'll say it again
I'm interested in more than just bein' your friend
I don't wanna break it, just want it to bend
Do you know how to bend?

I could eat that girl for lunch
She dances on my tongue
I know it's just a hunch
But she might be the one
I could
Eat that girl for lunch

I don't come down with the sun
I won't hate myself when the mornin' comes
No thoughts of your body runnin' through my head
No bottle of bourbon beside the bed, 'cause

It wasn't no thing to give you up
I never reach for you in another touch
Don't ever think about you with him
And girl, tonight I won't call again and again
Ain't nothin' but

[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes
I'm still a fool for you
Nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Lies, lies, lies
Girl, I'm on a downhill dive
Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So I just tell the same old lies, liеs, lies
Yeah, baby, I can try, try, try

[Verse 3]
To act like I don't givе a damn, but I do
Bet you're missin' me bad as I miss you
Snowballs to a phone call
Soundin' somethin' stupid
Baby, 'cause the truth is
The ninety proof is tellin' me
[Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes
I'm still a fool for you
Nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Lies, lies, lies
Girl, I'm on a downhill dive
Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So I just tell the same old lies, lies, lyin' to myself
Why, why, why in the hell
Do I keep sayin', ""I can get you back""?
That's about as honest as sayin' that

I don't come down with the Sun
I won't hate myself when the mornin' comes
Them ain't nothin' but

Lies, lies, lies
Look into my eyes, eyes, eyes

Habits and hard heartbreaks are hard to break
So I just tell the same old lies, lies, lies

[Интро: Future]
Е, е, Плуто

[Припев: Future]
Я не тусуюсь с крысами, это какое-то уникальное дерьмо
Прикончил ниггера так, что это попало в новости, типа того
Пью сироп и Actavis, в стиле Screw
Просто грустная шалава, трахающаяся со всеми пацанами из компании, типа того
У меня дома плохая сука, типа вуду
Уломал Меган Ти Сталлион и ее подруг, типа того

[Куплет 1: Future]
У нее прямо пышные формы, я просто думал, что ты знал, типа того
Я просто потратился, обычно не делаю такую хрень
Карманы набиты, все в синих, типа того
Куча богатых ниггеров, шалавы запутываются, типа того
Ниггер из Атланты, я живу, как Тед Тёрнер, типа того
На камеру, вышибаю челюсти, типа того
Я убрал её, выгнал со студии, типа того
Тихий убийца, я просто остаюсь спокойным с вами, мразями
Надёжный ниггер, который считает деньги, типа того
Катаюсь по городу с твоей подружкой, типа того
Она готова проглотить меня, как суп, типа того
Ты идёшь против пацанов, и ты проиграешь, типа того
Молись Богу, чтобы они вырубили тебя, типа того (Типа того)
[Куплет 2: Travis Scott]
Появляюсь, появляюсь, прямо из ниоткуда, типа того
Ввёл Double O в свою жизнь
Серотонин, это крутой тип микса
Оксиконтин, смешаю его с воздушными шариками (Хорошо)
Восточная Атланта чувствуется как зоопарк, такой микс
(Раскрывай)
Малышка, малышка танцует стриптиз, принимает грибы
Жру все Перки, типа как еду (Раскрывай)
Малышка танцует, с 9 утра до 5 вчера, типа того (Раскрывай)
Жру все Перки, типа как еду (Раскрывай)
Жру все Перки, типа как еду (Поднимаюсь)
Мои пацаны давят этого лоха, типа —  (Поднимаемся)
Заливаем место, как будто бассейн (Добавляй)
Мои пацаны давят этого лоха, типа того (Поднимаемся)
Мои пацаны давят этого лоха, типа — (Раскрывай)
Жру все Перки, типа как еду
Чувствую себя так, будто на луне

[Бридж: Future &  & ]
Исполняю медленный флоу, как в джиу-джитсу 
 
Поджариваю ниггера, как еду, типа того 
 

[Куплет 3: Playboi Carti & ]
Она схватила мои яйца, мне нужно отойти, типа того
Алмазы, они скрывают мои недостатки, я веду себя, как полностью новый, типа того
Сотня патронов в магазине, заставляют его взорваться, звучит, как ядерный взрыв
Все мои джинсы висят, кажется, я слишком тугой, типа того
Привел эту шалаву к банде, теперь она думает, что моя менеджерша, типа того
Малышка думала, что она особенная, но у меня всегда будет сука более значимая
Мне прямо сказали, что всё легко, и я чувствую себя полностью открытым
Восемьдесят одна тысяча на зубы, но я всё ещё не улыбаюсь этой суке
Эта шалава думает, что она лучше меня? Она та самая Инстаграм-модель
Малышка сказала, что я супергерой, так как черт возьми я собираюсь прятаться от этой хуйни?
Эта шалава делает мне минет на заднем сиденье, она типа двигает головой
Все, что я хочу - это жопу и сиськи, у меня нет определенного типа
Попиваю сироп, Плуто, жди
Попиваю сироп, Метро
Сижу прямо здесь с коксом, типа того
Могу поместить алмазы на свои перчатки, воу, как Майкл
Что за херня, вы все обсуждаете тела? Вы просто говорите о бреде 
[Припев: Future]
Я не тусуюсь с крысами, это какое-то уникальное дерьмо (Уникальное дерьмо)
Прикончил ниггера так, что это попало в новости, типа того

The smell of your perfume
I thought I was immune
Lookin' around this room
Can't help but see the traces of you
This moment is surreal
I can't put into words how I feel

Twin
Where have you been?

Nobody knows me like you do (Nobody)
Nobody gon' love me quite like you (Nobody, yeah)
Can't even deny it, every time I try it

Olivia Rodrigo,vampire,"[Verse 1]
Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

[Chorus]
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

[Verse 2]
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better
[Chorus]
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

[Bridge]
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

[Chorus]
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

Warren Zeiders,Pretty Little Poison,"[Verse 1]
Every night, 'round about this time
It's like she knows I'm lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leanin' on old memories
And talkin' 'bout what used to be
She'll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain't sweet

[Chorus]
She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty littlе poison

[Verse 2]
Shadows dancin' down the hall
Whispers that she wants mе
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind of fix
For me, she's the one I'll pick
Nothin' else will do the trick
She's all I need
[Chorus]
She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

[Bridge]
For some, I guess it's alcohol
I don't want none at all
I just want you
No, I just want you

[Chorus]
My pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time

(Pew, pew-pew)
En mode FPS, on transforme votre son en funérailles
A tous ces négros qui disent qu'ils veulent nous virer, vous feriez mieux de parler de travailler dans des bureaux
Ouais, ces gars l'avaient verrouillé, mais je connaissais le code
Beaucoup de négros discutent de ma place
Pas la trois, pas la deux, je suis le U-N-O
Ouais
Le numéro U-N-O
Moi et Drizzy, c'est comme le Super Bowl
Mеc, ce truc est presquе aussi lourd que le

[Refrain : Drake]
Aussi lourd que quoi ? (Ah)
Aussi lourd que quoi ? (Mm)
Aussi lourd que quoi ? (Ayy)
Aussi lourd que le Super Bowl

[Couplet 1 : Drake]
Mais la différence, c'est que c'est juste deux gars qui jouent le truc qu'ils ont fait en studio
Ces négros m'envoient souvent leurs couplets et ils sont éclatés, comme un enfant de deux ans
J'adore dîner avec des belles femmes quand elles commencent à débattre pour savoir qui est le G.O.A.T
Je suis en mode : allez-y, dites-le bordel, qui le G.O.A.T. ?
Qui est le G.O.A.T. ? Qui est le G.O.A.T. ? Qui est le G.O.A.T. ?
Salopes, qui est-ce que vous applaudissez vraiment ?
Comme un gosse qui se comporte mal de janvier à novembre, négro, c'est juste toi et Cole
[Refrain: Drake]
Aussi lourd que quoi ? (Ah)
Aussi lourd que quoi ? (Mm)
Aussi lourd que quoi ? (Ayy)
Aussi lourd que le Super Bowl

[Couplet 2 : J. Cole]
Les négros ont trop la dalle pour me clasher
Dissèquent mes mots et commencent à chercher trop profond
Je regarde les tweets et je serre les dents
Je laisse ça bouger parce que j'aime la mystique
Je veux toujours un son avec YB
Tu peux pas croire tout ce que tu vois sur Insta
Sache juste que si je fais un son sur toi, je m'assurerais que tu saches que je t'ai tapé comme si t'étais sur mon clavier
J'appelle l'album The Fall Off, c'est assez ironique parce que c'est pas une chute pour moi
Toujours dans cette salope qui grossit, comme s'ils attendaient que le gosse vienne tomber comme un père
J'aime quand ils débattent sur le MC le plus hardcore
C'est K-Dot ? C'est Aubrey ? Ou moi ?
On est les Big Three comme si on avait lancé une ligue, mais là, je me sens comme Muhammad Ali
Huh, ouais, ouais, huh-huh, ouais, Muhammad Ali
Celui qu'ils appellent quand leur merde se connecte plus, j'ai l'impression d'avoir un boulot en informatique
Poser avec moi est la plus grosse erreur
Le meme Spider-Man, c'est moi qui regarde Drake
C'est comme si on avait recruté tes potes pour être des putains de mascottes, on les a fait assister à ton réveil
Je déteste comment le rap s'est éloigné des mesures, mec, on dirait une putain d'évasion de prison
C'est tous des gangsters, et puis merde, tout le monde prend son petit-déjeuner et je suis sur le point de nettoyer mon assiette (Huh, huh, huh)
Quand je me pointe, c'est un blockbuster
Le G.O.A.T. avec le stylo doré, le top vendeur
Le coureur de lieux, a pulvérisé toute sa merde, l'aéronef
Pas la Russie, mais fais pression
A ton crâne, Cole est en automatique quand il les vise
Avec The Boy dans les statuts, un stade
Négro
[Partie II]

[Introduction : Drake]
Ayy, j'suis à deux doigts de, j'suis à deux doigts de
J'suis à deux doigts de, ouais
Ouais

[Couplet: Drake]
Cette merde est à deux doigts de me faire péter un plomb
J'suis à deux doigts de péter un plomb, woah
Cette merde est à deux doigts de me faire péter un plomb
J'suis à deux doigts de péter un plomb, woah
Vos putes vont me faire péter un plomb et faire une scène de crime
Je presse la gâchette du flingue comme un feu de route
Mec, j'étais le crisseur de roues de Bentley quand j'avais dix-neuf ans
Elle a appelé mon numéro, je l'ai laissée accrochée, elle a été nettoyée à sec
Elle a un Android, ses messages sont verts
Je cherche un nom, et je finis par tomber sur vingt salopes
Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlène, Pauline, Claudine
Mec, je les mets dans ce téléphone comme des sardines
Et elles m'envoient des photos nues, c'est les petits plaisirs de la vie
Vous êtes encore en train de prendre des photos sur un Gulfstream
Mes petits sont plus riches que vous, les rappeurs, et ils streament tous
Ça me fait vraiment chier que vous leur ayez vendu de faux rêves
Mec, si tes droits d'auteur sont en vente, j'achète tout
Me donneront-ils jamais des fleurs ? Bien sûr que non
Ils veulent pas en parler, parce que c'est un point douloureux
Ils connaissent The Boy, celui qu'ils doivent boycotter
J'ai dit à Jimmy Jam que j'utilise un GRAMMY comme cale-porte
Cette fille m'a donné des têtes parce que j'en ai besoin
Et si je te baise, après je pourrais la manger, quoi ?
Ces négros parlent de « quand ça va se répéter »
Qu'est-ce tu me racontes, gros ? Je suis à un de Michael
Négro, le battre, négro, le battre de quoi ?
[Outro : Drake]
Le battre de quoi ? Le battre de quoi ? Le battre de quoi ? Le battre de quoi ?
Le battre de quoi ? Le battre de quoi ? Le battre de quoi ? Le battre de quoi ?
Le battre de quoi ? Le battre de quoi ? Le battre, ayy, le battre de quoi ?
Me renvoyez même pas l’ascenseur, j’en ai pas besoin"

Here's my 2024 year-end list, a way for me to share all the artists, albums, and songs that made my year! And also a way to look back on my Genius journey (in which I was less active this year) :/
Each top is listed alphabetically 'cause it's just too hard to rank them."
Artemas,i like the way you kiss me,"[Intro]
I like the way you kiss me
I like the way you, uh

[Chorus]
I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached ('Tached, 'tached, 'tached)
I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached ('Tached, 'tached, 'tached)

[Verse 1]
You bite my lip just for the taste
You're on your knees, I'm on the case
You take the heat and with such grace
You say we'rе done, but here you stay
Said you'rе scared I'll let you down (I'll let you down)
Stick around and you'll find out (And you'll find out)
But don't you wanna make me proud? (Don't you wanna make me proud?)
'Cause I'm so proud, baby, I'm so proud of you

[Chorus]
I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back

I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached ('Tached, 'tached, 'tached)
[Verse 2]
Do I stress you out? Can I help you out?
Does it turn you on when I turn you 'round?
Can we make a scene? (Scene) Can you make it loud? (Loud)
'Cause I'm so proud, baby, I'm so proud of you

[Break]
(So proud of you)
(Mm, so proud of you)

[Chorus]
I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached ('Tached, 'tached, 'tached)
I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached ('Tached, 'tached, 'tached)

[Outro]
I like the way you kiss me
I like the way you, uh"
Jelly Roll,Need A Favor,"[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Verse 1]
I know amazin' grace, but I ain't been livin' them words
Swear I spend most Sundays
Drunk off my ass than I have at church
Hard cover King James
Only been savin' dust on the nightstand
And I don't know what to say
By the time I fold my hands

[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Post-Chorus]
Amen, amen
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I owe you more than one
And beggars can't be choosers
But I'll pay for all I've done
Just pleasе don't let me lose hеr

[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Post-Chorus]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen

[Bridge]
Hangin' in there just barely
Throwin' up prayers like Hail Marys
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Hail Mary
Hangin' in there just barely
Throwin' up prayers like Hail Marys
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Hail Mary
[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So tell me, who the hell am I to expect a savior
When I only talk to God if I need a favor?
And, God, I need a favor

[Post-Chorus]
Amen
God, I need a favor
Woah
Amen"

Kendrick Lamar,euphoria,"[Part I]

[Intro]
​eurt s'em tuoba yas yeht gnihtyrevE
Euphoria

[Verse]
Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard 
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you

[Part II]

[Intro]
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee
[Verse]
Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay
Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay
I ain't thinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay
Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay
Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay
Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway
And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame
Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns
Then hop online like ""Pray for my city,"" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky
I'll park his son
The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh
You know I got language barriers, huh
It's no accent you can sell me, huh
Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh
I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly
I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef
Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T
You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one
Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk
[Part III]

[Verse]
Remember?
Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?
Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?
Ho, what? You ain't like that record?
""Back To Back,"" I like that record
I'ma get back to that, for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you
Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you
Am I battlin' ghost or AI?
Nigga feelin' like Joe Hale Osteen
Funny, he was in a film called 
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America to imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie
I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie
Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas
I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm
Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food
Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too
If you take it there, I'm takin' it further
Psst, that's something you don't wanna do
[Outro]
Ooh
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
Stop"
HARDY,TRUCK BED,"[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
She said, ""Don't come home if you go to the bar""
I said, ""Okay, baby"" then got drunk out in the yard
2 AM I knock knock knocked up on the door
But she never unlock-locked it, guess I don't live there no more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, she meant business this time
I can't believe my bloodshot eyes

[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)
[Verse 2]
I used that empty bag of corn to rest my head
A camo jacket for a blanket then passed out like I was dead

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Still got one heck of a buzz
If I look a train wreck it's because

[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yeah
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yes I did

[Bridge]
I can't believe I gotta be at work at nine
That fuckin' bird's about to catch this .45
Oh, I guess if this really is goodbye (Ha)
At least I took my boots off this time, uh

[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve"
Bobby Helms,Jingle Bell Rock,"[Verse 1]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

[Verse 2]
Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet

Miley Cyrus,Flowers,"[Verse 1]
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I

[Chorus]
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

[Post-Chorus]
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

[Verse 2]
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry, but then remembered I

[Chorus]
I can buy myself flowers

Luke Combs,Where the Wild Things Are,"[Verse 1]
My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

[Verse 2]
He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

[Verse 3]
I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
(Oh, yeah)
[Bridge]
Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back East
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, oh-oh, they said he hit that guard rail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are

[Outro]
Out where the wild things are"

Xavi,La Diabla,"[Letra de ""La Diabla""]

[Verso]
Y yo puedo comerte como a ti te gusta
Si solo te dejas querer
En caliente yo voy por ti
Mija, aquí no muerdo, no se me asuste
No hay más tiempo que perder
Solo se vive una vez

[Coro]
Soy la mala influencia y eso te gustó
Eres niña mala, se nota, mi amor
Eres una diabla, mira cómo bailas
Del uno al diez, tú eres un millón
Si te vas conmigo, puro Christian Dior
Fendi, Balenciaga, pa' ti me sobra lana
Lo que quieras, mi amor
Mi chula princesa, te bajo la luna
Y si te dejas, verás quе ninguno te va a dar lo que yo te voy a dar

[Interludio]
Erеs una diabla

[Coro]
Soy la mala influencia y eso te gustó
Eres niña mala, se nota, mi amor
Eres una diabla, mira cómo bailas
Del uno al diez, tú eres un millón
Si te vas conmigo, puro Christian Dior
Fendi, Balenciaga, pa' ti me sobra lana
Lo que quieras, mi amor
Mi chula princesa, te bajo la luna
Y si te dejas, verás que ninguno te va a dar lo que yo te voy a dar

Myles Smith,Stargazing,"[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Time stood still just like a photograph
You made me feel like this would last forever
Lookin' in your eyes
I see my whole life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
They say you know it when you know it, and I know
Oh, oh
Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go ()

[Chorus]
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazin'
Intertwinin' souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

[Verse 2]
I losе my mind
When I'm around you, how I come alive
Whеn I'm without you, I can't help but feel so lost
I wanna give you all I've got
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
They say you know it when you know it, and I know
Oh, oh
Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go ()

[Chorus]
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazin'
Intertwinin' souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
All along
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along"
Wham!,Last Christmas - Single Version,"[Intro]
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby
[Verse 2]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 3]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
[Outro]
Special

Jelly Roll,I Am Not Okay,"[Verse 1]
I am not okay
I'm barely gettin' by
I'm losin' track of days
And losin' sleep at night
I am not okay
I'm hangin' on the rails
So if I say I'm fine
Just know I learned to hide it well

[Chorus]
I know I can't be the only one
Who's holdin' on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it's all said and done
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
It's not okay
But we're all gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I woke up today
I almost stayed in bed
Had the devil on my back
And voices in my head
Some days, it ain't all bad
Some days, it all gets worse
Some days, I swear I'm better off
Layin' in that dirt
[Chorus]
I know I can't be the only one
Who's holdin' on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it's all said and done
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
It's not okay
But wе're all gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Gonna bе alright

[Bridge]
I know one day
We'll see the other side
The pain'll wash away
In a holy water tide
And we all gonna be alright

[Chorus]
I know I can't be the only one
Who's holdin' on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it's all said and done
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
It's not okay
But we're all gonna be alright
I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright"
"Post Malone, Blake Shelton",Pour Me A Drink (Feat. Blake Shelton),"[Letra de ""Pour Me A Drink"", ft. Blake Shelton]

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Quarenta horas me fizeram enlouquecer
Os Dallas perderam outro jogo na prorrogação
Levei uma multa por passar dos 65
Não sei onde estou indo

[Verso 2: Blake Shelton]
Acho que eu realmente fui e ferrei com tudo de novo
Agora, a minha amada se foi mais do que os ventos de Tulsa
Julgando pelo sóbrio estado em que estou
Eu preciso abrir uma

[Refrão: Post Malone]
Alguém me sirva uma bebida, alguém me empresta um cigarro
'Tô prestes a ficar chapado, 'tô prestes a sequenciar vitórias
Sim, estive me esforçando, só acompanhando os Joneses
'Cês sabem o que eu quero dizer, e 'cês sabem como vai
Quando a sexta-feira chega e eu recebo o pagamento, mando uma pra cá
Eu mal consigo pensar quando ouço alguém chamando pelo o meu nome (Ei)

[Pós-Refrão: Post Malone]
Alguém me sirva uma bebida
Me sirva uma bebida
[Verso 3: Post Malone & ]
Os olhos marrons do Bourbon tentam me deixar bêbado
Não vou parar até que a garrafa e o trabalho esteja acabado
Ei, eu acho que talvez tenha encontrado o meu futuro amor


[Refrão: Blake Shelton]
Alguém me sirva uma bebida, alguém me empresta um cigarro
'Tô prestes a ficar chapado, 'tô prestes a sequenciar vitórias
Sim, estive me esforçando, só acompanhando os Joneses
'Cês sabem o que eu quero dizer, sim, 'cês sabem como vai
Quando a sexta-feira chega e eu recebo o pagamento, mando uma pra cá
Eu mal consigo pensar quando ouço alguém chamando pelo o meu nome (Ei)

[Pós-Refrão: Blake Shelton]
Alguém me sirva uma bebida
Alguém me sirva uma bebida

[Ponte: Post Malone]
Ooh

[Refrão: Post Malone & ]
Alguém me sirva uma bebida, 
'Tô prestes a ficar chapado, 
Sim, estive me esforçando,

Chris Stapleton,White Horse,"[Verse 1]
This love is getting kinda dangerous
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My mind, it's turning like a cloud of dust
My heart always wants to run

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

[Post-Chorus]
White horse

[Verse 2]
Someday, maybe you could have your way
Right now's just not the time
Some things a man's just got to do
I wish you could change my mind

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yеt
No, I ain't there yet

If you want a cowboy on a white horse

Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there

If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet

Look, let me tell you (Girl)

[Chorus]
You my lil' boo thang
So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know
You a lil' too tame

Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know

[Verse]
Put a lil' gold in the teeth
And the fit good, so I took the doors off the Jeep, okay
I see a brother holdin' your seat, no beef
But I'm tryna get to know you at least
Don't take my talkin' to you wrong
I can keep it chill like a sauvignon blanc
I'ma keep it real when your man long gone
If you're lookin' for a friend, then you got thе wrong song

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl, what's good, what's with ya?
If you booked tonight, that's fiction
I'm outside, no pictures
You want mе, go figure
To the back, to the front
You a ten, baby girl, but I'm the one (Hey)
To the back, to the front
You a ten, baby girl, but I'm the one (One)
[Chorus]
You my lil' boo thang
So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shootin' that shot like 2K, girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know

[Chorus]
You my lil' boo thang (Yeah)
So I don't give a hoot what your dude say, girl, I know
You a lil' too tame
I'll be shootin' that shot like 2K, girl, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know
Tell 'em I'm, tell 'em I'm next
Tell 'em you found a lil' somethin' too fresh, I know"

"4batz, Drake",act ii: date @ 8 (feat. Drake) - remix,"[Intro: 4batz]
You want me to pull up?

[Chorus: 4batz]
I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hundred for your fuckin’ hair
Two hundred for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair

[Verse 1: 4batz]
Girl, I got you another dress
So bring your ass up down them stairs
I buy you shit because you rare
And, plus, because you know I care
Bitch, you know you love it here
That’s why you keep on comin' near
Your nigga can't compete, I swear (Nah, for real)
He tried, but now he look too weak, baby

[Chorus: 4batz]
I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hundred for your fuckin' hair
Two hundred for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair
[Break: 4batz]
I’ll come and slide by 8 p.m.

[Verse 2: Drake]
What did I do to deserve you?
Don’t even know what I did
Been prayin' on it since a kid
I guess it’s just luck if you say so
How you get all of that body and face, though?
What kinda water they servin' in Clayco?
This is me talkin', it's not the añejo
Ready to pop out, but we gotta lay low
I really gotta calm down
’Fore I end up in jeopardy just like the game show
Broski my twin, that's my bestie
He love me, said I got the blessin'
I swear he's gassin' me up
There's no way in hell I see you passin' me up
Almost said I loved your ass right after we fucked
Don't know why, girl, it was on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, found someone I'm fallin' for
You hit me back, we're talkin' more now
The bodies that you caught before (They don't)
Make me mad or insecure (I'm good)
A thousand on your fuckin' hair
Two hunnid on your fuckin' nails, for real
This shit feel like a fairy tale (I swear)
I'll make them open up Chanel, ch-ch
I'm a stand-up guy like Dave Chappelle
I was cursed, you 'bout to break the spell, for real
Tell that nigga that you done with him
Girl, who cares if he gon' take it well? You're done
[Outro: 4batz]

"Koe Wetzel, Jessie Murph",High Road (feat. Jessie Murph),"[Letra de ""Koe Wetzel - High Road (Ft. Jessie Murph) (Traducción al Español)""]

[Verso 1: Koe Wetzel]
Puedo decir que estás enfadado
Y no me sorprende ni la mitad
Desde el día que nos conocimos
Siempre es quién corta primero y nunca quién sangra último
Los rumores siempre se convierten en gritos y peleas
Y una vez que están en tu mente, solo hay una forma de conducir

[Coro: Koe Wetzel]
Lo sé, lo sé
Voy a tomar el camino correcto, nena, colócate
Toma un poco demasiado de algo terrible
Te dejaré que te calmes mientras salgo
No me estás arruinando como las veces anteriores
No necesito una entrada para tu espectáculo de mierda
Date por vencido y toca fondo
Bueno, voy a tomar el camino correcto, tomar el camino correcto, tomar el camino correcto

[Verso 2: Jessie Murph]
No quieres hablar de ello, muchacho, no es ninguna sorpresa
Vuelves a casa oliendo a licor como todas las noches
Si te pillo con Ella, me vas a atrapar con él
Crees que no me entero de ello, será mejor que lo pienses de nuevo
Sabes que los rumores siempre se convierten en gritos y peleas
Y una vez que está en mi mente, solo conduzco en una dirección

Lo sabes, lo sé
Tomaré el camino correcto, nena, colócate
Toma un poco demasiado de algo terrible
Dejaré que te calmes mientras salgo
No me estás arruinando como las veces anteriores
No necesito una entrada para tu espectáculo de mierda
Date por vencido y toca un nuevo fondo
Bueno, tomaré el camino correcto, tomaré el camino correcto, tomaré el camino correcto
Whoa, whoa

Rien à faire sinon mentir

J'ai mis un chèque autour de mon cou, la vie te vérifie par la tête
J'ai signé pour quelques millions, t'as touché que cent mille

Regarde, en direct de
En direct de celui après cinq

Pourquoi je vois toujours tes potes dans la ville ?
Je pense que vous avez laissé des soldats derrière

Ça va pas marcher, nan
J'ai retiré ça de la table
OVO, c'est un label
Je reste avec ce O comme un pneu
Je reste avec ce O comme un bagel
Je reste avec ce O comme un sauveur
Dédicace à mon ex, je suis son sauveur
Mon Glock repose sur la table de nuit
T'as rien à la taille comme un sabre laser
À Seattle, c'est juste moi et Twizz'
Je vous déteste plus que je l'ai jamais fait
Vous rappez des trucs que vous n'avez jamais faits

Libère le gamin, libère le gamin, libère le gamin

Quelques-uns de mes potes en coupent (Luh geek)
Ouais, certains de mes potes en vendent beaucoup
J'ai entendu dire que ton argent a été pris comme un déjeuner (Hah)
On est sur le côté et on punit
Salope, je dors le jour, je ne vois pas le soleil (Uh-huh, ouais)
Grosse Lamborghini garée dehors au soleil, ça peut t'attraper, ça peut te faire frire
T'as vraiment pas de style, alors qu'est-ce que t'as fait ?
Ton petit pote a essayé de prendre le mien (Woo)
J'ai jamais eu besoin d'aide, j'ai jamais eu besoin de personne, je fais pas la queue(Woo)
Ça va prendre une minute, donne-moi l'heure
Si t'as commis le crime, salope, pourquoi tu pleures ?

Parker McCollum,Burn It Down,"[Verse 1]
Goodbye, strung out on the lawn
The line between us was drawn
All I can see is you're gone and you left me here
With this house on this ground, burn it down

[Verse 2]
I'll leave my memories inside
In that bed, we loved in all night
Every word, every fight
Every feelin', stone cold, not a sound

[Chorus]
Burn it down 'til it's ashes and smoke
Burn it down to the smolderin' coals
Burn it down 'til I don't want you no more
Baby, burn it down

[Verse 3]
Every last song that I wrote
About me and you growing old
Every sliver of hope everything I know
Pile it up right now

Burn it down 'til it's ashes and smoke
Burn it down to the smolderin' coals
Burn it down 'til I don't want you no more
Baby, burn it down

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too

This is where it ends

But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down

Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pridе to let that happen again
So this is wherе it ends

[Verse 2]
Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I shoulda walked out that door

Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends, ends, ends
Yeah, this is where it ends

[Bridge]
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
You showed me what true love shouldn't be
I found myself the second I gave up on us

[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance (Second chance)
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends"

Say, say I wanna go there, then I wanna leave
Make another promise that I can't keep
I don't ever know what I want, but that's what you want
If you're down, well, then don't blame me
Breakin' it all before it starts, makin' it all up in my head
But I just overshare 'bout things I never meant

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a wild ride that never stops
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a hard case they can't unlock
And I, and I swear I care a lot, just not enough
Let's just say it is what it is and was what it was (Was)

[Chorus]
Kisses to my exes who don't give a shit about me
Kisses, kisses to the next ones who think they can live without me (Nah, nah)
We make up, then we break up, then they swear they'll never call me (Yeah)
But I still keep their number and their necklace, kisses to my exes
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry that you love me (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Changed my mind up like it's origami
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry that you love me (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Changed my mind up like it's origami (Ha-ha)

[Outro]
Kisses to my exes, I know that I did you dirty
Little messed up, little selfish, we ain't married, I ain't thirty
Yeah, we hooked up, then we broke up, then I said you really hurt me
But I still got your number and your necklace, kisses to my exes"

Have a holly jolly Christmas 
It's the best time of the year

Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you 
Kiss her once for me

Tucker Wetmore,Wind Up Missin’ You,"[Verse 1]
I know I might look like
Another ball cap on a bar stool
Underneath a PBR light
Sayin' everything under the moon
To get you into my arms tonight
You probably heard it all a thousand times
But it ain't what it looks like
Girl, let me tell you what it looks like

[Chorus]
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
You look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you

[Verse 2]
I gotta tell you, baby, I've been
The kind of boy your daddy never wanted
You to go and fall in love with
The kinda boys you're probably done with their dumb shit, yeah
I bet you heard the stories and
Can't say I'm proud of that, but
I've turned the page on the old me
And now I ain't lookin' back 'cause
[Chorus]
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin'

[Bridge]
Missin' you in the mornin'
Probably for the next few years
When I look back on it
I'll still see you right here

[Chorus]
You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you
[Outro]
Wind up missin' you
Wind up missin' you"
Nate Smith,Bulletproof,"[Verse 1]
Usually, these ol' neon lights
Are pretty good for bad goodbyes
They got some girls off of my mind
But, baby, not tonight
'Cause I've been puttin' in overtime
Tryin' to get over your leavin'
You're still right here, on my mind
You sure did a number on me

[Chorus]
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything thеy've got
But the whiskey don't kill likе it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way I'm driving home
I'm three sheets, done tied one on
But this liquor ain't as strong
As your sweet love is
[Chorus]
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything they've got
But the whiskey don't kill like it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

[Bridge]
All my favorite country songs
Guess they must've got it wrong
'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone
You ain't gone, baby

[Chorus]
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything they've got
But the whiskey don't kill like it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof
[Outro]
All my favorite country songs
Guess they must've got it wrong
'Cause I'm still here and you ain't gone
You ain't gone, baby
Oh-oh, you ain't gone, baby
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof"

Cody Johnson,The Painter,"[Verse 1]
She talks about the future like she's flippin' through a magazine
Finds the beauty in the thrown away and broken things
Gets excited about all my crazy dreams

[Verse 2]
Got every sunset that she's ever seen memorized
Saves them away for a rainy day or stormy night
The sky is brighter lookin' at it through her eyes

[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter

[Verse 3]
She reminds me that it ain't too late to start again
Fine is good, but you need some blue every now and then
How'd I live so long without her reckless touch?

[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter
[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter

[Outro]
She's the painter"
Taylor Swift,Down Bad,"[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
[Verse 2]
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him
[Bridge]
I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him
[Outro]
Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him"
Dua Lipa,Dance The Night,"[Verse 1]
Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Ooh, my outfit so tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight
I can take the heat, baby, best believe
That's the moment I shine

[Refrain]
'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

[Pre-Chorus]
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

[Chorus]
Watch me dance, dance the night away
My hеart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dancе, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

[Verse 2]
Lately, I been movin' close to the edge
Still be lookin' my best
I stay on the beat, you can count on me
I ain't missin' no steps

'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

[Pre-Chorus]
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

[Chorus]
Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

[Post-Chorus]
When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

[Bridge]
Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)
Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face (Yes, I can, yes, I can)
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place
[Chorus]
Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance (Dance), dance the night away (Uh-huh)

When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play safe, don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night"
